		<text><![CDATA[Many ringers have struggled to understand the guidance for this weekend, but the CCCBR has just sent around a remarkably clear email:
<br>From: Vicki Chapman
<br>Date: Fri, Sep 9, 2022 at 9:17 PM
<br>Subject:Further guidance on open ringing for the proclamation announcement
<br>To:
<br>
<br>Following further discussion and interpretation of the CofE guidance, we suggest the following for open ringing following the proclamation of the new Monarch expected on Saturday.
<br>
<br>Open ringing from 11am (BST) on Saturday (D+1) following the proclamation announcement until the flags are lowered again at 1pm (BST) on Sunday.
<br>
<br>Bells should then revert to being rung muffled/half muffled until the end of the day of the state funeral.
<br>
<br>This is suggested guidance, please do liaise with local church authorities for local arrangements.]]></text>

He has discovered so much fascinating information about the bells he has put it together in a book, Tales from the Tower, which also includes a brief history of the art of English Bell Ringing.
Copies are on sale for £7.99, or a nicely rounded up £10.00 if you would like to include a small donation to our Bell Restoration Appeal.

		<headline><![CDATA[100-club doubling of price and prizes - change your standing orders now]]></headline>
		<link><![CDATA[]]></link>
		<text><![CDATA[HCACR Good news!
<br>
<br>The HCACR 200-Club was instigated in 1986 when the original number of subscribers was 100, the subscription was an annual £10, and total prizes of £500 were given out. Since then we have doubled the number of subscribers, doubled the number of prizes and doubled the amount transferred to the Bell Restoration Fund. In the intervening 34 years the value of the prizes has unfortunately become less impressive and the £1000 contribution to the BRF has devalued over the years. The current £10 sub, adjusted for inflation, would be about £29 in today’s money.  
<br>
<br>At the 2020 Annual General Meeting, held via Zoom on 29 August, it was agreed that it was essential to raise more money for the BRF to enable it to continue to make significant awards for bell restoration projects. Following a vote, the meeting agreed to double the 200-club sub to £20, with prizes also being doubled, with effect from 1 January 2021.  Monthly prizes will increase to two of £50. The prizes for the draw at the AGM will be two of £300, and two of £200 at the Kimpton Cup draw. The contribution to the BRF will increase to £2000, enabling more significant awards for bell restoration projects.
<br>
<br>This of course means that we have to ask you to double your subscription from January 2021. If you have a standing order, please change it as soon as possible to £20 (other details, including the account name of "100 club", remain the same). If in the past you have paid by cash or cheque it would be a huge help if you could set up a standing order to save administration work and costs. Contact David for bank details. 
<br>
<br>Please ensure you put your name and 200-club number as a reference if you're setting up a new order.
New subscribers need to contact the administrator to get a number, currently just a few available. (<script>m2("dgambling","gmail",0,"","email David")</script>)
<br>
<br>Thank you for your current and continued support.]]></text>

		<link><![CDATA[]]></link>
		<text><![CDATA[Following the devastating fire at the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris on 15th April, the Archbishops of Canterbury & York and Prime Minister Theresa May asked for bells at churches and cathedrals across the UK to ring out in solidarity on Thursday 18th April (Maundy Thursday). Ringing in the week before Easter is usually prohibited, but many towers in Hertfordshire got agreement from their vicar and got bands together at short notice, or tolled the tenor for 7 minutes at 7pm to show their support.

		<headline><![CDATA[Western District ADM report]]></headline>
		<link><![CDATA[]]></link>
		<text><![CDATA[HCACR Western District held their ADM on 12th January 2019, hosted by St Mary’s, Hemel Hempstead.  The meeting was chaired by Tony Crowther, County Secretary.  Western District meetings follow a familiar format: ringing for 90 minutes, a service in church, the business meeting, a scrumptious tea provided by the host tower, then further ringing before gathering in a local pub.  After efficiently completing the set business, we moved onto the election of officers, although in this case it was largely a re-election, as our officers do such a fabulous job! There have been two key changes due to time-served; namely to our Ringing Master and Deputy.  They are now respectively Karen Dunn (from Hemel Hempstead) and Sue Bassett (from Kings Langley).  Grateful thanks were given to Liz Middleton and Su Gambling for their combined years of energy and excellence in these roles. 

  <br><br>

The Western District has a lively and enthusiastic membership, and holds well-attended monthly meetings for ringers of all standards.  As an adult learner, I have found a warm welcome and plenty of advice to help develop my skills and confidence.  At the ADM, I found myself volunteering to undertake the role of reporting to Ringing World, without really knowing what is involved, nor my fellow ringers knowing if I can write.  In The Olde Kings Arms afterwards, I was enthusiastically contemplating writing a regular article in the style of Tim Dowling. Turned out that none of the company reads the Saturday Guardian.  Here begins a journey of discovery for us all.

However, it was not without enduring a certain amount of pain, especially during the last 6 miles. Two days and two hot baths later, my legs are slowly beginning to return to normal!<br><br>I would like thank all of you who have already donated to our appeal, but if you would like to make a contribution as a reward for my efforts we would be most grateful.<br><br>Further information and details of how to pay are provided by clicking the link at the bottom. Maybe if paying by cheque, you could just attach a 'post-it' mentioning the marathon so I can get some idea of how much I have raised?<br><br>Very many thanks.<br><br>Jerry<br><br><a href='https://www.saintmichaelweb.org.uk/Articles/542915/Church_Bells_Restoration.aspx' target='_blank'>https://www.saintmichaelweb.org.uk/Articles/542915/Church_Bells_Restoration.aspx </a>]]></text>

		<text><![CDATA[Thanks to all who bought a quiz, hopefully this will have raised a significant amount for our bell repair fund, but the total amount is unknown at this point in time.<br> There were 32 entries and 4 people scored a perfect 80/80. Congratulations to them (John Southey, Shirley Parker, Steve Thomas, Beverley Tapper) and the winner is... Beverley Tapper with a tie breaker "Woe Begone" (Bengeo) so well done to her, £10 will be on its way soon.<br>A big thank you to the many of helpers who helped come up with clues, printed, sold, distributed copies and marked answers.]]></text>

		<link><![CDATA[]]></link>
		<text><![CDATA[The Ridgman Trophy is awarded to the winner of a striking competition on ten bells, held annually in May or June. The territorial associations in East Anglia (including the Lincoln Guild) often enter teams, and others are welcome as space permits. 
The Hertfordshire 10-bell team exceeded expectations by coming second. Despite only having had one practice, and that without the full band, the team rang better than ever to beat some of the best teams in the area. 
On the glorious ten at Daventry on 4th June 2016, the competition was judged by Anne and Jeremy Pratt.]]></text>
